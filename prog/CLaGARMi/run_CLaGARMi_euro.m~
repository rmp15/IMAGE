% Run this from the 'IMAGE' dir. You'll need to add the 'v1' dir to the
% matlab path. CLaGARMi is Correlated Latent Gaussian Auto-Regressive Model
% (iterative) in case you were wondering.

% Loads a set of arbritrary test data extracted from E-Obs. The metadata
% in the 'v' struct is all nonsense apart from 'lbound' and 'o', 'o' is the
% observation data. This should fit and run in a few minutes - at least it
% does on my 8-core work desktop. There is also a bigger test data set in 
% the image_test_data folder, here the metadata is used to 'regrid' for mapping.
